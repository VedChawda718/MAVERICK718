           <br>
            <p>There’s only so far you can go with theoretical knowledge.
                To really develop your skills and begin your web development career, you’ll need relevant experience working with a team.
                Web developer internships provide you with the opportunity to get hands-on exposure using web development tools on real-life projects. 
                You’ll work with leading web developers and have the chance to learn from them.
                 Internships also improve your communication, team working, time management, self-motivation, and organizational skills.                
                Many web developer internship positions will naturally lead to full-time jobs. 
                So securing an internship at a top tech firm gets your foot in the door and helps kickstart your dream career.</p>
